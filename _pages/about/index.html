Iâ€™m also interested in exploring new approaches to statistical inference, optimization techniques, and their applications in fields like ecology and beyond. Alongside my research, I enjoy teaching and helping students navigate the world of statistics.</p> <p>I hold a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Belgrade, as well as two MSc degrees: one in Applied Mathematics and the other in Mathematical Statistics, from the University of Grenoble Alpes and the University of Belgrade, respectively.</p> </body></html>
