Hi, I am Predrag, a postdoc in mathematical statistics at the University of Copenhagen.

I hold a double PhD in mathematical statistics from the University of Copenhagen (KU) and Bielefeld University (UNIBI). I was working under the supervision of [Prof. Susanne Ditlevsen](https://web.math.ku.dk/~susanne/) from KU and [Prof. Roland Langrock](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/wirtschaftswissenschaften/lehrbereiche/stats/team/prof.-dr.-roland-langrock/) from UNIBI. 

My research focuses on developing statistical methods for stochastic processes, particularly in stochastic differential equations (SDEs). You can find my PhD thesis [here](https://noter.math.ku.dk/phd24pp.pdf). I'm also interested in exploring new approaches to statistical inference, optimization techniques, and their applications in fields like ecology and beyond. Alongside my research, I enjoy teaching and helping students navigate the world of statistics.

I hold a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Belgrade, as well as two MSc degrees: one in Applied Mathematics and the other in Mathematical Statistics, from the University of Grenoble Alpes and the University of Belgrade, respectively.
